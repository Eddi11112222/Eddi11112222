ðŸ‘¾ About Me â€“ Eddi11112222
===========================

Hey! I'm Eddi, a passionate hacker and creator with a love for all things tech and chaos.  
I specialize in building weird, fun, and sometimes creepy digital projects, often using Python, Arduino, and ESP32. I also enjoy playing around with microelectronics and security research.

Here's a little about me:

ðŸ”§ **Skills & Interests**
- **Languages**: Python, C, C++, JavaScript, HTML/CSS
- **Tools**: Arduino, ESP32, Raspberry Pi, Wi-Fi Hacking, BLE, GPIO
- **Projects**: Prankware, DIY electronics, ethical hacking, IoT, automation
- **Security**: Ethical Hacking (Wi-Fi Penetration Testing), OSINT, Hardware Hacking
- **Frameworks**: Tkinter, PyQt, Flask, Node.js

ðŸŽ® **Hobbies**
- Creating prank tools (don't worry, theyâ€™re safe, I swear!)
- Working on DIY electronics projects (always tinkering)
- Playing with microcontrollers and sensors
- Exploring new hacking tools and techniques (ethical, of course)
- Having fun with cybersecurity and penetration testing

ðŸ‘¾ **Current Projects**
1. **VOID OS â€“ Nightmare Edition** â€“ A fake-malware prank OS designed to confuse and scare (in the best way possible).
2. **Flipper Zero DIY Project** â€“ Turning my Flipper Zero into an all-in-one hacking tool with Bluetooth and sensor integration.
3. **WIFI Hacking & Repeater Tools** â€“ Creating Wi-Fi tools to play with networks and experiment with ethical hacking.

âš¡ **On the Horizon**
- More releases of **VOID OS** with even creepier features.
- Expanding my knowledge of **BLE** communication for IoT and security projects.
- Building **ethical hacking** tools for penetration testing and network analysis.
